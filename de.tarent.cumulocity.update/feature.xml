      The “Cumulocity Nodes” collection provides functionality to retrieve
information about IoT devices, corresponding measurements, alarms
and events from a given Cumulocity IoT platform instance. This
data, possibly in combination with any other data, can be used
to create new events and alarms within KNIME and write them back
to Cumulocity in order to trigger the corresponding actions within
Cumulocity.
